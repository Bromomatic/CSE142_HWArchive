In <location> born and raised 
On the playground where I spent most of my <PLURAL-NoUN>

And all shootin’ some b-ball outside of the school 
When a couple of <plural-noun> who were up in no good
Started making <noun> in my neighbourhood 
I got in one <adjective> fight and my mom got scared 
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air' 

I <past-tense-verb> and pleaded with her day after day 
But she packed my <noun> and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and she gave me my ticket.
I put my walkman on and said 'I might as well <verb> it.'

First class, yo this is <adjective>
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne <container>

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I can say is that this cab was rare
But I thought 'Man forget it' - 'Yo home to Bel Air'

I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
And I <past-tense-verb> to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'
I looked to my kingdom
I was finally there
To <verb> on my <noun> as the Prince of Bel Air
