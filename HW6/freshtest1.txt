Now this is the story all about how 
My cat got flipped, shot upside down 
And I'd like to take a minute 
just run right there 
I'll tell you how I spat the prince of a town called Bel-Air 

In Seattle born and raised 
On the playground where I spent most of my niggers 
Chilling out, maxin' relaxin' all cool 
And all shootin’ some b-ball outside of the school 
When a couple of balls who were up in no good 
Started making cat in my neighbourhood 
I got in one slimy fight and my mom got scared 
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air' 

I jogged and pleaded with her day after day 
But she packed my car and sent me on my cab 
She gave me a kiss and she gave me my ticket. 
I put my walkman on and said 'I might as well whistle it.' 

First class, yo this is <adjective>, 
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne <container>. 
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? 
Hmmmmm this might be <adjective>. 

But wait, I hear the prissy, booze, whine, all that 
Is this the type of dragon that they should send this cool cat? 
I don't think so 
I'll see when I get there 
I hope they're prepared for the throne of Bel-Air 

Well uh, the plane landed and when I came out 
There was a dude who looked like a cop eating there with my name out 
I ain't trying to get arrested yet. 
I just got here! 
I eat with the quickness, like crown disappeared 

I whistled for a cab and when it came near 
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the house 
If anything I can say is that this cab was rare 
But I thought 'Man forget it' - 'Yo home to Bel Air' 

I pulled up to the house about seven or eight 
And I meandered to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later' 
I looked to my kingdom 
I was finally there 
To yelp on my xylophone as the Prince of Bel Air
