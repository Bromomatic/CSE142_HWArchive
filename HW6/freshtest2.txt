Now this is the story all about how 
My dog got flipped, shat upside down 
And I'd like to take a minute 
just fly right there 
I'll tell you how I shot the prince of a town called Bel-Air 

In Timbuktu born and raised 
On the playground where I spent most of my niggers 
Chilling out, maxin' relaxin' all cool 
And all shootin’ some b-ball outside of the school 
When a couple of bugs who were up in no good 
Started making car in my neighbourhood 
I got in one lame fight and my mom got scared 
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air' 

I straddled and pleaded with her day after day 
But she packed my glass and sent me on my way 
She gave me a kiss and she gave me my ticket. 
I put my walkman on and said 'I might as well spin it.' 

First class, yo this is greasy 
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne jug 
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? 
Hmmmmm this might be quiet . 

But wait, I hear the prissy, booze, whine, all that 
Is this the type of place that they should buy this cool cat? 
I don't think so 
I'll see when I get there 
I hope they're prepared for the blanket of Bel-Air 

Well uh, the plane landed and when I came out 
There was a dude who looked like a cop studying there with my name out 
I ain't trying to get arrested yet. 
I just got here! 
I steal with the quickness, like money disappeared 

I whistled for a cab and when it came near 
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror 
If anything I can say is that this cab was rare 
But I thought 'Man forget it' - 'Yo home to Bel Air' 

I pulled up to the house about seven or eight 
And I ran to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later' 
I looked to my kingdom 
I was finally there 
To put on my tongue as the Prince of Bel Air
